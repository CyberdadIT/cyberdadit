My first month on TryHackMe taught me more about practical cybersecurity than any textbook. Here's everything I learned and wish I knew from day one.

## Why TryHackMe?

TryHackMe is one of the best platforms for getting hands-on with cybersecurity. Unlike reading about vulnerabilities in a textbook, TryHackMe lets you attack and defend real (virtualised) machines.

## Getting Started

The first thing you'll want to do is set up your environment. I recommend starting with:

1. A Kali Linux VM or the TryHackMe AttackBox
2. A stable internet connection
3. A note-taking tool (I use Obsidian)

## My First Room

The "Complete Beginner" path was my starting point. It covers everything from basic Linux commands to network exploitation.

## Key Takeaways

- **Hands-on learning beats passive reading** — actually running Nmap against a target teaches you more than reading about it
- **Take notes on everything** — you'll forget syntax, but notes save you
- **Don't rush** — it's tempting to look at hints immediately, but struggling builds real skills

## What's Next

I'm currently working through the "Jr Penetration Tester" path and documenting each room as I go. Stay tuned for detailed writeups!
