Detailed walkthrough of the Basic Pentesting room on HackTheBox, covering reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation techniques.

## Reconnaissance

The first step in any penetration test is reconnaissance. I started with a basic Nmap scan:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN initial_scan 10.10.10.50
```

This revealed several open ports including SSH (22), HTTP (80), and SMB (139/445).

## Enumeration

### Web Server

Browsing to port 80 showed a default Apache page. I ran Gobuster to find hidden directories:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.50 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

### SMB Shares

Using `enum4linux`, I discovered accessible shares and usernames on the system.

## Exploitation

With the gathered credentials, I was able to gain initial access via SSH and then escalate privileges using a misconfigured SUID binary.

## Lessons Learned

- Always enumerate thoroughly before attempting exploitation
- SMB can be a goldmine of information
- Check SUID binaries as part of privilege escalation
