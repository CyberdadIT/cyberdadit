A Python-based network scanning tool that identifies active hosts, open ports, and running services. Features multi-threading for faster scans and detailed reporting.

## Features

- Multi-threaded port scanning for fast results
- Service version detection
- OS fingerprinting
- Export results to CSV and JSON
- Interactive CLI interface

## How It Works

The tool leverages Python's `socket` library combined with threading to perform concurrent port scans across target hosts. Results are parsed and formatted into detailed reports.
